- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Useful resources

- [Developer Mozilla Top Border Box](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/CSS/border-top-left-radius) - This helped me because I didn't know how to use the border-radius property just in the top of my image, for the right top border you just change left with right.
- [Box Shadow Generator](https://cssgenerator.org/box-shadow-css-generator.html) - This is an amazing tool that I used for creating box shadows.
